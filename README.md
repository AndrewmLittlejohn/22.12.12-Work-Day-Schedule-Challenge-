# 22.12.5-Work-Day-Schedule-Challenge

This calendar has coloration added to the test areas to demonstrate whether or not the time of day has occured, based on 24 hour time. When saved the information is stored and local storage
and pulled back to the page upon reload. 

If you attempt to save a time block with nothing you will be alerted that the block is emppty and thus nothing was saved. 

I would like to find a way to accomplish this with a series of loops instead of having to write 9 versions of the same function multiple times. This being said with as many things that were changing I couldn't, with relative efficiency, come up with a time efficient way to accomplish this with loops.
